{"name":"Phoenix Software Craftsmanship Book Club","tagline":"","body":"We're an open group of Phoenix-area software engineers and developers! We meet [weekly on Wednesday nights from 8pm to 10pm at Gangplank in Chandler](#where).\r\n\r\nQuestions? [Contact Mike Christianson][1].\r\n\r\n### Current book\r\n\r\n*[Good Math: A Geek's Guide to the Beauty of Numbers, Logic, and Computation][2]*\r\n\r\n### [![Good Math cover](http://www.smugmug.com/photos/i-vHNF5rZ/0/Th/i-vHNF5rZ-Th.jpg)][2]\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nWe read an agreed upon portion of the book on our own, then meet the following week to discuss what we've read. Occasionally we take turns presenting. <a name=\"where\" /> \r\n\r\n### Where do you meet?\r\n\r\nOur group meets at [Gangplank Chandler][3] in the *Burgundy Lounge*, the first conference room on the right toward the rear of the building. Just ask someone to point you in the right direction if you need help finding us. \r\n\r\n### Is the group right for me?\r\n\r\nThe group is focused on professional development for software engineers and developers. You should review the list of our [previously read books](#past-books) and judge your skill and experience accordingly. If you are new to programming or are a student, you may be better served by a study group made of your peers. \r\n\r\n### Should I wait until you start a new book?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the book. But, really, it's up to you.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### Next book: *???* -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"past-books\" /> \r\n\r\n### Past books\r\n\r\n* *Clean Code*\r\n* *TDD by Example*\r\n* *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*\r\n* *Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*\r\n* *Learn You A Haskell*\r\n* *Refactoring to Patterns*\r\n* *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited*\r\n\r\n### Potential Future Books and Topics\r\n\r\n* *New Turing Omnibus*\r\n* *Continuous Delivery*\r\n* *Ship It!*\r\n* *Growing OO Software Guided by Tests*\r\n* *Domain Driven Design*\r\n* *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*\r\n\r\n[1]: https://codeaweso.me/_/contact/\r\n[2]: https://codeaweso.me/_/goodmath\r\n[3]: http://gangplankhq.com/chandler/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
